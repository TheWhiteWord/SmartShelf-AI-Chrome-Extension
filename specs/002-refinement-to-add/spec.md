# Feature Specification: SmartShelf Offline Capabilities & Constitutional Compliance Refinement

**Feature Branch**: `002-refinement-to-add`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "refinement to add offline capability requirements - CRITICAL ISSUES resolution: Clarify API Gateway scope as export-only (constitutional compliance), Add missing FR-014 offline functionality implementation tasks, Define measurable AI processing quality criteria, Consolidate duplicated search requirements FR-006/FR-011, Standardize collection vs category terminology"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A SmartShelf user needs to access their knowledge collection and perform basic operations when internet connectivity is unavailable or unreliable. They should be able to browse previously saved content, search their existing collection, add manual notes to items, and organize content using categories and collections - all while maintaining constitutional compliance with Chrome Built-in AI API privacy requirements and clarified export-only external access.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** user has previously saved content while online, **When** they open SmartShelf without internet connection, **Then** they can access and browse their entire saved collection with <2 second load time
2. **Given** user is offline, **When** they search their collection using natural language queries, **Then** search results appear within 500ms using locally cached search index
3. **Given** user is offline, **When** they add personal notes or change categories for existing items, **Then** changes are saved locally and sync when connection is restored
4. **Given** user has generated an export-only API token, **When** external applications request collection data, **Then** system provides read-only access to structured knowledge base without violating privacy principles
5. **Given** user attempts to save new web content while offline, **When** they click the extension button, **Then** system queues the content for processing when connection returns with clear status indication

### Edge Cases

- What happens when offline storage quota is exceeded during extended offline usage?
- How does system handle search queries for content that requires AI processing when offline?
- What occurs when user attempts to export data via API while offline?
- How does system behave when local data becomes corrupted during offline operations?
- What happens when user tries to add physical items requiring Internet Archive lookup while offline?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Offline Capability Requirements

- **FR-015**: System MUST provide full read access to previously saved content when offline with <2 second initial load time
- **FR-016**: System MUST enable local search across cached content with <500ms response time when offline
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow users to add personal notes and modify categories for existing items while offline
- **FR-018**: System MUST queue new content captures for AI processing when connection is restored
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide clear visual indicators distinguishing between online, offline, and syncing states
- **FR-020**: System MUST maintain local data integrity during offline operations with automatic conflict resolution on reconnection

#### Constitutional Compliance - Export-Only API Access

- **FR-021**: System MUST provide export-only API access for external applications to query knowledge base in read-only mode
- **FR-022**: System MUST authenticate external API access using secure tokens with configurable expiration periods
- **FR-023**: System MUST NOT allow external applications to modify, delete, or add content through API endpoints
- **FR-024**: API responses MUST include only user-approved data fields (summary, tags, categories) without exposing raw content unless explicitly permitted
- **FR-025**: System MUST log all external API access attempts for user review and security monitoring

#### AI Processing Quality Criteria

- **FR-026**: AI summarization MUST achieve minimum 85% relevance accuracy as measured against user-validated test content
- **FR-027**: AI categorization MUST suggest appropriate categories with >80% precision based on content topic analysis
- **FR-028**: AI-generated tags MUST include 3-5 relevant keywords with confidence scores >0.7 on 1.0 scale
- **FR-029**: AI connection discovery MUST identify related items with >75% user-confirmed relevance when connection strength exceeds 0.6
- **FR-030**: System MUST complete AI processing pipeline within 5 seconds for text content <10KB, 15 seconds for content >10KB

#### Unified Search & Organization

- **FR-031**: System MUST provide unified search capability across all content types (digital, physical, notes) using single natural language interface
- **FR-032**: Search MUST return results ranked by relevance score with highlighted matching terms and connection explanations
- **FR-033**: System MUST enable search within digital versions of physical items when Internet Archive content is available
- **FR-034**: Users MUST be able to organize items using both hierarchical categories and flexible collections with drag-drop interface
- **FR-035**: System MUST maintain consistent terminology using "categories" for hierarchical organization and "collections" for project-based grouping

#### Performance & Storage Requirements

- **FR-036**: System MUST support offline storage of up to 10,000 items with <100MB total local storage usage
- **FR-037**: System MUST maintain responsive UI (<200ms interaction response) even with maximum offline content load
- **FR-038**: System MUST automatically sync offline changes within 30 seconds of connection restoration
- **FR-039**: System MUST provide selective sync options allowing users to control which content remains available offline

### Key Entities

- **ContentItem**: Represents saved digital or physical content with metadata, AI-generated summaries, categories, and offline availability status
- **OfflineCache**: Local storage manager for cached content, search indexes, and user modifications during offline periods  
- **SyncQueue**: Manages pending operations (new content, AI processing, user changes) for execution when online
- **ExportToken**: Secure authentication credential for external read-only API access with defined permissions and expiration
- **SearchIndex**: Locally cached searchable representation of content optimized for offline natural language queries
- **Category**: Hierarchical organizational structure for content classification (standardized terminology)
- **Collection**: Project-based grouping of related items for flexible organization (standardized terminology)
- **QualityMetric**: AI processing confidence scores and user feedback for continuous accuracy improvement
