## Notes

- All [P] tasks can be executed in parallel when prerequisites are met
- TDD approach: All tests (T006-T030) MUST be written and failing before implementation
- Chrome Extension testing requires special setup with Chrome Extension Testing Framework
- AI API testing should include both mock data and real content scenarios
- Performance testing crucial for 10k+ item collections requirement
- **Chrome DevTools MCP Integration**: Constitutional requirement for real-time debugging, AI API monitoring, and automated testing workflows (see CHROME-DEVTOOLS-MCP-SETUP.md)
- Demo video (T080) should highlight constitutional principles and competitive advantages
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Continue with current monolithic approach for hackathon, plan modular refactor for post-hackathon development
- **TESTING UPDATE (2025-09-29)**: Enhanced integration testing with T022 (content capture) and T023 (search) adds 22 new tests, bringing total to 493/493 tests passing across 24 test suites
