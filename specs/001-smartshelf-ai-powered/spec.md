# Feature Specification: SmartShelf - AI-Powered Personal Knowledge Hub

**Feature Branch**: `001-smartshelf-ai-powered`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "SmartShelf - AI-Powered Personal Knowledge Hub Chrome Extension with physical and digital content management, Chrome Built-in AI APIs integration, Internet Archive content access, and API gateway for external LLM integration"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A knowledge worker (student, researcher, or professional) browses the web and encounters valuable content they want to preserve and organize. They use SmartShelf to instantly save articles, videos, and web pages with one click. The extension automatically summarizes content, categorizes it intelligently, and connects it to their existing knowledge collection. They can also add physical books and materials they own, with the system automatically finding and indexing digital versions when available. Users can search their entire collection using natural language, get AI-generated insights about relationships between items, and export their knowledge base for use with other AI tools and applications.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** user is reading an article on a website, **When** they click the SmartShelf extension button, **Then** the page is saved with AI-generated summary, tags, and category assignments
2. **Given** user has saved multiple items about machine learning, **When** they search for "neural networks", **Then** system returns relevant saved content with AI-highlighted connections and related materials
3. **Given** user owns a physical book on data science, **When** they add it to their collection, **Then** system finds the digital version on Internet Archive and enables content search within that book
4. **Given** user wants to use their collection with an external AI assistant, **When** they access the API endpoint, **Then** system provides structured access to their knowledge base with proper authentication
5. **Given** user saves a YouTube video, **When** the content is processed, **Then** system generates summary, extracts key topics, and suggests related items from their collection

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Internet Archive doesn't have a digital version of a physical book?
- How does system handle very large collections (1000+ items) while maintaining performance?
- What occurs when Chrome Built-in AI APIs are temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system behave when users try to save password-protected or subscription content?
- What happens when external API access is attempted without proper authentication?
