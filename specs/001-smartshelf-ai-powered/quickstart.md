- ✅ Physical and digital versions linked when available
- ✅ Location tracking works correctly

## Test Scenario 4: AI Content Connections

### Steps

1. **Ensure diverse content collection** (technology, science, business articles)
2. **Save related content** (e.g., multiple articles about "user experience design")
3. **Open any saved item** in detail view
4. **Check "Related Items" section**
5. **Verify AI-generated connections**:
   - Similar topics are connected
   - Connection strength indicators visible
   - Connection explanations provided

### Expected Results

- Brief explanation of why items are related
- Connections help discover forgotten related content

### Success Criteria

- ✅ AI identifies topical relationships between items
- ✅ Connection strengths are reasonable and helpful
- ✅ Explanations make sense to users
- ✅ Helps surface relevant related content

## Test Scenario 5: External API Access

### Steps

1. **Generate API token** in SmartShelf settings
2. **Copy API endpoint and token** from settings panel
3. **Test external API call**:

   ```bash
   curl -H "X-SmartShelf-Token: [your-token]" \
        "http://localhost:8080/api/external/content?include=summary,tags"
   ```

4. **Verify JSON response** contains collection data
5. **Test different query parameters** (format, filtering)

### Expected Results

- API token generation works correctly
- External HTTP requests return valid JSON
- Response includes requested data fields
- Authentication prevents unauthorized access

### Success Criteria

- ✅ API token system functions
- ✅ External applications can access collection data  
- ✅ JSON format is well-structured and useful
- ✅ Security controls work (token required)

## Performance Validation

### Response Time Requirements

- **Content Capture**: <2 seconds from click to save
- **AI Processing**: <5 seconds for summary generation
- **Search Queries**: <500ms for results display
- **Collection Loading**: <1 second for 100+ items
- **API Responses**: <200ms for external requests

### Memory Usage Validation

- Monitor Chrome Task Manager during testing
- Extension should use <50MB RAM for 100 saved items
- Background processing should not block UI interactions
- Large collections (1000+ items) should remain responsive

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### AI Processing Failures

- **Symptom**: Content saves but no summary appears
- **Solution**: Check Chrome Built-in AI API availability
- **Fallback**: Manual summarization and categorization options

### Internet Archive Timeouts

- **Symptom**: Physical books don't find digital versions
- **Solution**: Verify internet connection and try alternative search terms
- **Fallback**: Manual digital version linking

### Search Performance Issues

- **Symptom**: Slow search results (>2 seconds)
- **Solution**: Check collection size and consider re-indexing
- **Mitigation**: Pagination and result limiting

### Extension Permission Issues

- **Symptom**: Content capture fails on certain websites  
- **Solution**: Review and update host permissions in manifest
- **Workaround**: Manual content entry for restricted sites
