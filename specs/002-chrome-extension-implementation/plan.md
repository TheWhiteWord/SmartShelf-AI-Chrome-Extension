# Implementation Plan: Chrome Extension Implementation with MCP-Automated Testing

**Branch**: `002-chrome-extension-implementation` | **Date**: 2025-10-02 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/media/theww/AI/Code/AI/Google_Chrome_Built_In/specs/002-chrome-extension-implementation/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Systematic validation and refinement of the SmartShelf Chrome Extension using automated Chrome DevTools MCP testing workflows. This phase focuses on loading the existing comprehensive codebase (625+ tests, complete implementation) into Chrome Developer Mode and executing automated testing workflows to ensure all features work correctly in real Chrome environments, particularly Chrome Built-in AI APIs, content capture workflows, and user interface components.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2022, HTML5, CSS3 (Chrome Extension Manifest V3)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Chrome DevTools MCP, Chrome Built-in AI APIs (Prompt, Summarizer, Writer, Rewriter), Node.js v22.12.0+, VS Code GitHub Copilot Chat  
**Storage**: Chrome Storage API (local/sync), IndexedDB for large datasets, existing comprehensive implementation  
**Testing**: Chrome DevTools MCP automated workflows, existing Jest test suite (625+ tests), Puppeteer for E2E extension testing  
**Target Platform**: Chrome Browser (Desktop/Mobile) with Manifest V3 support, Chrome Developer Mode for extension testing
**Project Type**: single (Chrome Extension with MCP-automated testing workflows)  
**Performance Goals**: <5s AI processing response, <500ms search response, <2s extension loading time, real-time debugging feedback  
**Constraints**: Client-side only processing, Chrome Developer Mode requirements, MCP tool compatibility, automated workflow execution  
**Scale/Scope**: Single developer testing workflows, comprehensive extension validation, 12+ automated test scenarios, 4+ AI API integrations

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **AI-First Architecture**: Feature validates existing Chrome Built-in AI APIs integration (Prompt, Summarizer, Writer, Rewriter) through automated MCP testing workflows
- [x] **Privacy-Local Processing**: MCP testing validates client-side AI processing, ensures no external AI API calls during automated validation workflows
- [x] **Extension-Native Design**: MCP workflows test seamless Chrome integration (Content Scripts, Service Worker, Side Panel, Popup) in real browser environment
- [x] **Test-Chrome-APIs Integration**: Comprehensive automated testing of AI API functionality using MCP workflows with real content and error handling validation
- [x] **Hackathon-Focused Scope**: MCP testing phase is completable within timeline, validates demo-ready functionality for 3-minute video creation
- [x] **Debug-Native Development**: Core feature IS chrome-devtools-mcp integration for real-time debugging, AI API monitoring, and automated extension validation

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base  
- Generate MCP workflow automation tasks from quickstart scenarios
- Each MCP test scenario → automated workflow implementation task [P]
- Each Chrome Extension component → MCP validation task [P]
- Each performance requirement → measurement and profiling task [P]
- Existing extension codebase integration and validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:

- MCP setup and environment preparation first
- Extension loading validation before functional testing
- AI API testing before content workflow testing
- UI component testing after core functionality validation
- Performance profiling and optimization last
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent workflows)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered MCP automation tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Progress Tracking

*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
