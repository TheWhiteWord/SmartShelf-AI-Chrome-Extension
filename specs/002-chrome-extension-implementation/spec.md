# Feature Specification: Chrome Extension Implementation with MCP-Automated Testing

**Feature Branch**: `002-chrome-extension-implementation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Chrome Extension Implementation with MCP-Automated Testing - Systematic implementation of SmartShelf extension using Chrome DevTools MCP for automated testing, debugging, and validation of all features including Chrome Built-in AI APIs, content capture workflows, and user interface components"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a Chrome Extension developer with comprehensive tests and implementation code, I want to systematically validate and refine my SmartShelf extension using automated Chrome DevTools MCP testing workflows so that I can ensure all features work correctly in real Chrome environments before final deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the SmartShelf extension codebase with 625+ tests, **When** I load the extension in Chrome Developer Mode via MCP automation, **Then** the extension loads successfully without errors and all components are accessible
2. **Given** the extension is loaded in Chrome, **When** I trigger Chrome Built-in AI API testing via MCP workflows, **Then** all AI services (Summarizer, Prompt, Writer, Rewriter) initialize correctly and process test content
3. **Given** the extension AI services are functional, **When** I execute content capture workflows via MCP automation, **Then** web page content is extracted, processed by AI, and stored successfully with proper categorization and tagging
4. **Given** content has been captured and processed, **When** I test the search functionality via MCP automation, **Then** natural language queries return relevant results within performance requirements (<500ms)
5. **Given** all core features are validated, **When** I run comprehensive extension workflow tests via MCP, **Then** all user interfaces (popup, sidepanel, options) function correctly and communicate properly with the service worker

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Chrome Built-in AI APIs are unavailable or disabled?
- How does the extension handle content capture failures on restricted websites?
- What occurs when storage quotas are exceeded during bulk content processing?
- How does the extension behave when network connections fail during Internet Archive API calls?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST load the SmartShelf Chrome Extension in Chrome Developer Mode without installation errors
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate Chrome Built-in AI API availability and initialization for all supported APIs (LanguageModel, Summarizer, Writer, Rewriter)
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute automated content capture workflows from real web pages to validate content extraction and AI processing
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform automated testing of natural language search functionality with performance validation
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate Chrome Storage API operations for both local and sync storage with quota management
- **FR-006**: System MUST test extension UI components (popup, sidepanel, options page) for proper functionality and visual rendering
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate service worker background processing and message communication between extension components
- **FR-008**: System MUST execute automated debugging workflows to identify and resolve integration issues
- **FR-009**: System MUST perform performance profiling of AI processing operations to ensure sub-5-second response times
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate extension security model and permissions in Chrome's sandboxed environment
- **FR-011**: System MUST test error handling and graceful degradation scenarios when Chrome APIs are unavailable
- **FR-012**: System MUST automate regression testing workflows to prevent feature breakage during refinements

### Key Entities

- **Extension Instance**: Loaded Chrome Extension in Developer Mode with all components active
- **MCP Test Session**: Automated testing session using Chrome DevTools MCP for systematic validation
- **AI Processing Pipeline**: Background service worker operations handling content analysis and enhancement
- **Content Capture Workflow**: End-to-end process from web page interaction to stored, AI-processed content
- **User Interface Components**: Extension popup, sidepanel, and options page with interactive elements
- **Performance Metrics**: Measured response times, memory usage, and operation success rates during testing
- **Test Scenarios**: Predefined user workflows executed automatically via MCP for comprehensive validation
